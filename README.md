#Ble-Gatt-Movesense-2.0

An example on how to subscribe, i.e. enable notifications, for IMU data from a Movsense device to an Android device,
using Bluetooth LE. The interesting part is in the DeviceActivity, and especially the BluetoothGattCallback.

NB! The Movsense device must be updated with the Movesense-gatt_sensordata_app_w_bootloader DFU file.
You find this file on the course webb.
